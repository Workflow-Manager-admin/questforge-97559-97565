## How to Play

1. **Create Your Character**:
   - Enter a name for your character
   - Select a class (Warrior, Mage, or Rogue)
   - Each class has different starting stats affecting health, attack, and defense

2. **Explore the Map**:
   - Use the directional controls to move around the map
   - Grass tiles are light green, forest tiles are darker green
   - Enemy locations are marked with special indicators when visible
   - Items are shown with a different indicator on the map

3. **Combat**:
   - When you encounter an enemy, combat begins automatically
   - Choose your action: Attack, Use Item, or Flee
   - Combat is turn-based - you act first, then the enemy responds
   - Defeating enemies grants experience and gold

4. **Inventory Management**:
   - Open your inventory during exploration or combat
   - Use items to restore health or boost stats
   - Your inventory has a maximum capacity of 10 items

5. **Leveling Up**:
   - Gain experience points by defeating enemies
   - When you reach enough XP (level Ã— 100), you'll level up automatically
   - Leveling up increases your health, attack, and defense stats
